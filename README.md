# lgpdnowgpt
This project was designed to engage the LGPDNOW team to work better with the LLM tool internally.  Here I propose we create experts in each [knowledge area of our company as well as develop new LLM tools to achieve specific objectives using a little AutoGPT.

When create the repository, remember to create a folder named PDFs at the root, as that is where the files should be sent.


Activating the Virtual Environment: To activate the virtual environment managed by Poetry, you can use the command poetry shell. This will place you inside the virtual environment, where you can run scripts and programs that depend on the installed libraries.

Run the Poetry installation command. Inside the project folder, in the terminal or command prompt, execute the following command: poetry install

This command will read the pyproject.toml file, resolve the dependencies, and install everything necessary in the project's virtual environment. Poetry automatically creates and manages this virtual environment for you, which helps to keep the project's dependencies separate from the global Python libraries on your machine.



to run local you nedd to install:
 pip install InstructorEmbedding torch sentence_transformers
