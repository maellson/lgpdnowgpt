# lgpdnowgpt
This project was designed to engage the LGPDNOW team to work better with the LLM tool internally.  Here I propose we create experts in each [knowledge area of our company as well as develop new LLM tools to achieve specific objectives using a little AutoGPT.

When create the repository, remember to create a folder named PDFs at the root, as that is where the files should be sent.
